# Rating

Renders a rating component. Can be used anywhere a rating is needed - user self evaluation, world / rule system / DM reviews and more.

By default, the rating component will render a 5 icon rating system. The user can click on the icons to select a rating, or hover over them to see the rating they would select. Supports half points.

Uses antd's [Rate](https://ant.design/components/rate/) component with custom icon.

## Default

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.storyDefault} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

Note that the disabled state is not interactive - only the resulting rating is shown.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.storyDisabled} />
</Canvas>
