# Evaluation

Renders a rating component with a label and optional description, with integrated voting API endpoints.

## Default

By default, every evaluation is rendered into its own card. In this case, it takes up more space.

Example of usage - self evaluation in user settings.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.StoryDefault}/>
</Canvas>

## Compact

It is possible to render evaluations in a compact mode. In this case, the rating component is rendered inline only with title and rating.

Example of usage - self evaluation view in user profile.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.StoryCompact}/>
</Canvas>
